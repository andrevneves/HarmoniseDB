# HarmoniseDB
* HarmoniseDB is not ready for use. It is a brand new project under construction.
* HarmoniseDB is intended to be a Universal Windows Application that allows a developer to keep their local SQL Server based development environment in sync with their remote environments.

#### Why Would I Use HarmoniseDB?
* Because you work in a Development team who regularly make database changes to a SQL Server Environment.
* Because each developer works in a local environment, and when changes are deployed it can become cumbersome keeping your local environment up to date.
* Because you trust the remote environment and want it to automatically feed changes to Schema and Data back to your Environment, so you don't have too.
